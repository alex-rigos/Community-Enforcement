# Usage
## Simulation
1. Open `ComEn-Parameters.jl` to set up the simulation parameters (and Save).
2. Execute `ComEn-Simulations.jl` to run the simulation with the given parameters.
3. Execute `ComEn-Plots.jl` to plot the result of the simulations.

## Arrow Plots
1. Open `ComEn-Parameters.jl` to set up the simulation parameters (and Save).
2. Open `ComEn-Arrows.jl` to change the population parameters. (Since this is run for many different populations (for many different initial conditions), the population settings in `ComEn-Parameters.jl` are ignored. The same goes for the generations).
3. Execute `ComEn-Arrows.jl` to run the simulations with the given parameters and get the arrow plots.
